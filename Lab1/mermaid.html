<h1>Mermaids</h1>
<p> A mermaid is a legendary aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish.<br />
 Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia.<br />
 The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out <br />
 of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, <br />
 storms, shipwrecks and drownings..</p>
